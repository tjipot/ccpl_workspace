****
The most distant way in the world
is not the way from birth to the end.
It is when I sit near you
that you don't understand I love you.

The most distant way in the world
is not that you're not sure I love you.
It is when my love is bewildering the soul
but I can't speak it out.

The most distant way in the world
is not that I can't say I love you.
It is after looking into my heart
I can't change my love.

The most distant way in the world
is not that I'm loving you.
It is in our love
we are keeping between the distance.

The most distant way in the world
is not the distance across us.
It is when we're breaking through the way
we deny the existence of love.

So the most distant way in the world
is not in two distant trees.
It is the same rooted branches
can't enjoy the co-existence.

So the most distant way in the world
is not in the being seperated branches.
It is in the blinking stars
they can't burn the light.

So the most distant way in the world
is not the burning stars.
It is after the light
they can't 
****
be seen from afar.

So the most distant way in the world
is not the light that is fading away.
It is the coincidence of us
is not supposed for the love.

So the most distant way in the world
is the love between the fish and bird.
One is flying at the sky,
the other is looking upon into the sea.
